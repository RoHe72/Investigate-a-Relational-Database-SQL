Investigate a Relational Database
I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions about the database.

The project end-result is a presentation of four slides. Each slide:

Has a question of interest.
Has a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
Has a supporting visualization created using the final data of my SQL query that answers my question of interest.
The four questions of interest are:

*Who are the top 10 customers for the years 2007 and how many did they pay in total ? *
What is the highest and lowest amount in a month for each top client? ?
Which category of Ô¨Ålm praised our best customer the most ?
Which category among family movie is the most praised and which is the least  ?
Software requirements
You should have SQL, Excel
